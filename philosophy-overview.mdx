## Core Principles

Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium in ancient Athens, teaches that virtue is the highest good and that we should focus on what we can control while accepting what we cannot. This philosophy provides a practical framework for living a meaningful life.

## The Dichotomy of Control

This fundamental concept helps reduce anxiety by focusing energy on actionable items. Understanding what you can and cannot control is essential for mental peace.

## The Four Cardinal Virtues

Stoicism identifies four interconnected virtues that guide ethical living. These principles provide a moral compass for decision-making.

## Modern Applications

Stoic philosophy remains remarkably relevant today, offering practical tools for contemporary challenges like social media anxiety, work stress, and relationship difficulties.

<CodeGroup tabs="Workplace Example,Relationship Example">
  ```javascript
// Applying dichotomy of control at work
function handleWorkChallenge(challenge) {
  const controllable = ["My effort", "My attitude"];
  const uncontrollable = ["Colleague behavior", "Market conditions"];
  
  return {
    focus: controllable,
    accept: uncontrollable
  };
}
  ```
  ```javascript
// Practicing justice in relationships
function maintainHealthyRelationship() {
  return {
    listen: "Actively",
    empathize: "Genuinely", 
    communicate: "Honestly",
    respect: "Boundaries"
  };
}
  ```
